# Instructions: 

In pairs or teams, choose one of the two challenges below on which to work.
Use any programming language you like to solve it. 
If you finish early, try the other one! 

## 1. Valid Date
Write a program which will accept a date in either long hand or short hand (i.e. either 22/8/2018 or 22nd August, 2018) and work out if the given date is valid. E.g. 14/13/2018 is not valid.

## 2. Quick Report
Create a program which will accept a series of numbers (these could for instance be a series of marks for an assessment) and then produce a quick report. The report should include the mean, mode and median. 

_Bonus:_
Include standard deviations. Your report can also include a histogram of the values, e.g.:

	1 | ***
	2 | *
	3 | *******
	4 | ****
	5 | **
