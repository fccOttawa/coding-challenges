# Code Challenges - December 6th 2018
### 1. Letter Changes

Create a function that takes a string and replaces every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). 
Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string. 

#### Sample Test Cases
```
Input:"hello*3"
Output:"Ifmmp*3"

Input:"fun times!"
Output:"gvO Ujnft!"
```

### 2. Time Convert
Design a function that takes a number of minutes and returns the number of hours and minutes it converts to (ie. if num = 63 then the output should be 1:3). Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon. 

#### Sample Test Cases
```
Input:126
Output:"2:6"

Input:45
Output:"0:45"
```
