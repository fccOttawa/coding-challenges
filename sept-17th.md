Choose a problem below to work on in teams or pairs. Solve in any programming language. Good luck!

## Following day
Write a program that accepts a day name from the user, then shows the name of the following day. Incorrect inputs must be taken into account.

## Twice as old
Write a function that takes two arguments:
- Current father's age (years)
- Current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).

## Fill a range
Write a function that accepts two non-consecutive numbers as arguments, i.e. 1, 10 or 20, 40 etc.
Come up with as many ways as possible to fill the missing numbers between the two arguments, e.g.:
Input: 1, 10
Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
If your programming language has a built in range method or similar, do not use it in your solutions. 

## Reverse a string 
Classic technical interview question! Come up with at least one way to reverse a string, and then come up with more!
